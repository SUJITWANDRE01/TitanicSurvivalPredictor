# Titanic Survival Predictor

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using Logistic Regression. The application analyzes the Titanic dataset, performs data preprocessing, and builds a predictive model.

## Features
- Data visualization of passenger survival
- Survival prediction based on key passenger attributes
- Detailed analysis using Logistic Regression
- Visualizations of:
  - Survival distribution
  - Survival by gender
  - Survival by passenger class
  - Age distribution
  - Fare distribution

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Ensure `TitanicDataset.csv` is in the same directory
2. Run the script:
```bash
python TitanicSurvivalPredictor.py
```

## Key Components
